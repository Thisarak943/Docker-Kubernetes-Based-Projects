Docker + Kubernetes Based Projects
----------------------------------

This repository contains a collection of projects that demonstrate the use of Docker and Kubernetes in real-world DevOps scenarios. These projects were created to gain practical experience in containerization, orchestration, and automated deployment processes.

Each project folder includes relevant documentation, configurations, and instructions to help understand how Docker and Kubernetes are used together to build scalable and manageable applications.

Project Highlights:
- Dockerized applications using optimized Dockerfiles
- Use of Docker Compose for multi-container setups
- Kubernetes deployments including Pods, Services, Deployments, ConfigMaps, and Secrets
- CI/CD pipeline integration using Jenkins with Docker and Kubernetes
- Helm chart usage for Kubernetes packaging and versioning

What I Learned:
- How to containerize applications and manage images
- Kubernetes object management and YAML configuration
- Deploying and managing applications on local clusters (Minikube/Docker Desktop)
- Creating Jenkins pipelines for automated deployment to Kubernetes
- Managing environment-specific configurations securely using Secrets and ConfigMaps
- Using Helm to simplify deployment and parameterize configurations

This repository is part of my DevOps learning journey and serves as a portfolio of practical implementations that cover containerization and orchestration fundamentals.

Feel free to explore each project folder for complete documentation and setup instructions.
